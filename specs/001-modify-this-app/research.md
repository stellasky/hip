# Research: Musical Band Fan Appreciation App

## Research Findings

### AWS Location Services for Mapping
**Decision**: Use Amazon Location Service with MapLibre GL JS for interactive maps
**Rationale**: 
- Integrates seamlessly with AWS Amplify Gen 2 architecture
- Supports offline capability through tile caching
- Cost-effective compared to Google Maps for expected usage
- Constitutional compliance with AWS-first approach
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Google Maps (higher cost, external dependency)
- OpenStreetMap with Leaflet (less AWS integration)
- Mapbox (additional external service dependency)

### Photo Storage Strategy
**Decision**: AWS S3 with Amplify Storage category
**Rationale**:
- Built-in integration with Amplify Gen 2
- Automatic resize and optimization capabilities
- Secure access control through Cognito
- Meets 10MB file size and 200MB user limits
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct S3 API (violates constitutional no-direct-AWS-SDK rule)
- Third-party storage (unnecessary complexity)

### Data Model Approach
**Decision**: AppSync with DynamoDB for user-generated content, JSON files for static band/POI data
**Rationale**:
- Static data (bands, POI details) rarely changes, JSON files are efficient
- User data (visits, comments, photos) needs real-time sync via AppSync
- Last-write-wins strategy easily implemented with DynamoDB
- Supports unlimited scaling per constitutional requirements
**Alternatives considered**:
- Full database approach (unnecessary complexity for static data)
- Pure JSON approach (doesn't support real-time user features)

### Map Integration Patterns
**Decision**: Dual-view architecture with shared state management
**Rationale**:
- React 19's improved state management for view synchronization
- Reusable POI components for both list and map views
- Maintains single source of truth for POI data
**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate data fetching per view (inefficient)
- Map-only interface (doesn't meet user requirements)

### Testing Strategy for Map Components
**Decision**: Mock map services in unit tests, use visual regression testing for integration
**Rationale**:
- Map rendering is complex to test traditionally
- Focus on component behavior rather than map library internals  
- Visual testing catches layout and interaction issues
**Alternatives considered**:
- Full map integration testing (too complex and slow)
- No map testing (insufficient coverage)

### Authentication Flow Design
**Decision**: Amplify UI Authenticator with custom styling
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for Amplify UI components
- Handles OAuth, MFA, and password policies automatically
- Can be styled to match app design
- Reduces custom authentication code
**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom authentication UI (more work, potential security issues)
- Headless authentication (doesn't meet UI requirements)

### Performance Optimization Strategy
**Decision**: React 19 Compiler + Lazy loading + Image optimization
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement to leverage React 19 optimizations
- Large image files need lazy loading for performance
- Automatic optimization reduces development overhead
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual optimization (violates React 19 first principle)
- No optimization (poor user experience)

## Technical Decisions Summary

| Category | Decision | Impact |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Mapping | Amazon Location Service | AWS integration, offline support |
| Storage | Amplify Storage + S3 | Constitutional compliance, automatic optimization |
| Data Architecture | Hybrid AppSync/JSON | Efficient static data, real-time user data |
| Authentication | Amplify UI Authenticator | Reduced complexity, constitutional compliance |
| Performance | React 19 Compiler + optimizations | Automatic improvements, better UX |
| Testing | Mock services + visual regression | Faster tests, better coverage |

## Implementation Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| Map rendering performance | Medium | High | Implement tile caching, lazy loading |
| Photo upload failures | Medium | Medium | Add retry logic, progress indicators |
| Concurrent editing conflicts | Low | Medium | Implement last-write-wins clearly |
| Static data management | Low | Low | Document update process clearly |

All research findings support constitutional requirements and clarified user preferences.
