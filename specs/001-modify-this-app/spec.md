# Feature Specification: Musical Band Fan Appreciation App

**Feature Branch**: `001-modify-this-app`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Modify this app from a todo list, to a fan appreciation app, the fan will select the musical band and the app will show them a list of addresses that are significant to the history of the band, the user will be able to select the band and a list of addresses will show up, there will also be a map view like google maps, that will show the points of interest on the map. The user can click on the point of interest (poi) and see a page describing the significants of the place. The user will also be able to mark the address as visitied or not. The user will also be able to comment on and upload pictures of the poi."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Feature description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → ✅ COMPLETE: actors (fans), actions (select, view, mark, comment), data (bands, POIs), constraints (map integration)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] where applicable
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Clear user flow identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → ✅ COMPLETE: All requirements testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Band, POI, User, Visit, Comment, Photo entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   → ⚠️ WARNING: Some [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present for data sources and permissions
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: For photo storage, what are the acceptable file size and storage limits per user? → A: Medium files: 10MB max per photo, 200MB total per user
- Q: What performance target should the app meet for loading POI data and maps? → A: No specific targets: Load times can vary based on network conditions
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent users editing the same POI (comments/photos)? → A: Last-write-wins: Most recent edit overwrites previous changes
- Q: What authentication method should be used for user accounts? → A: AWS Cognito: Use existing AWS authentication service
- Q: How many POIs per band should the system initially support? → A: Unlimited: No preset limits on POIs or bands

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A music fan opens the app to explore historically significant locations related to their favorite bands. They select a band from a list, view points of interest (POIs) on both a list and interactive map, learn about each location's significance, track their visits, and share their experiences through comments and photos.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fan opens the app, **When** they browse the band selection interface, **Then** they see a list of available musical bands to choose from
2. **Given** a fan has selected a band, **When** they view the band's page, **Then** they see a list of historically significant addresses and locations related to that band
3. **Given** a fan is viewing band locations, **When** they switch to map view, **Then** they see all POIs displayed as markers on an interactive map interface
4. **Given** a fan clicks on a POI marker or list item, **When** the POI detail page loads, **Then** they see detailed information about the location's historical significance to the band
5. **Given** a fan is viewing a POI detail page, **When** they mark the location as visited, **Then** the system records their visit and updates the POI's status accordingly
6. **Given** a fan wants to share their experience, **When** they add a comment and upload photos to a POI, **Then** their content is saved and becomes part of the location's community contributions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to upload an extremely large photo file?
- How does the system handle locations with no available photos or comments?
- What occurs when map data is unavailable or slow to load?
- How does the app behave when a user tries to mark the same location as visited multiple times?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a selection interface displaying available musical bands
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a list of historically significant addresses/locations for each selected band
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide an interactive map view showing POI markers for band-related locations
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to switch between list view and map view of POIs
- **FR-005**: System MUST display detailed information pages for each POI describing its historical significance
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to mark POIs as "visited" or "not visited"
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to add text comments to POIs
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to upload and attach photos to POIs
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist user visit status, comments, and uploaded photos
- **FR-010**: System MUST display user-generated content (comments and photos) on POI detail pages
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide user authentication using AWS Cognito to associate visits, comments, and photos with specific users
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle concurrent user interactions with POI data using last-write-wins strategy where most recent edit overwrites previous changes

*Requirements needing clarification:*
- **FR-013**: System MUST source band and POI data from a json data : for initial implementation use a static data sourcec.
- **FR-014**: System will not enforce content moderation at this time
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle photo storage with maximum 10MB per photo file and 200MB total storage per user
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide map functionality with aws mapping and offline capability

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System performance targets are flexible and may vary based on network conditions and device capabilities
- **NFR-002**: Photo uploads are constrained by file size (10MB max) and user storage limits (200MB total)
- **NFR-003**: System MUST support unlimited number of POIs per band and unlimited number of bands without preset limits

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Band**: Represents a musical group with name, description, and associated historical locations
- **Point of Interest (POI)**: Represents a historically significant location with address, coordinates, description, and significance to specific bands  
- **User**: Represents an authenticated fan who can interact with POIs through visits, comments, and photos
- **Visit**: Represents a user's record of visiting a specific POI, with timestamp and visit status
- **Comment**: Represents user-generated text content associated with a specific POI, linked to the commenting user
- **Photo**: Represents user-uploaded images associated with specific POIs, including metadata and user attribution
