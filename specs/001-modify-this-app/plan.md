# Implementation Plan: Musical Band Fan Appreciation App

**Branch**: `001-modify-this-app` | **Date**: 2025-10-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/coryluellen/Documents/spec/hip/specs/001-modify-this-app/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Transform the existing todo list application into a musical band fan appreciation app. Users can select bands, explore historically significant locations (POIs) in both list and interactive map views, learn about each location's significance, track visits, and share experiences through comments and photos. The app leverages React 19, AWS Amplify Gen 2 with Cognito authentication, AppSync/DynamoDB for data persistence, and AWS mapping services for geolocation features.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.6+, React 19, Node.js (for Amplify functions)  
**Primary Dependencies**: AWS Amplify Gen 2, React 19, Vite 5.4+, AWS AppSync, AWS Cognito, Amplify UI React  
**Storage**: Amazon DynamoDB (via AppSync), AWS S3 (for photo storage), JSON static data (initial band/POI data)  
**Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, TDD methodology with Red-Green-Refactor cycle  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (ES2020+), AWS Amplify Hosting, mobile-responsive design
**Project Type**: Web application (React frontend + AWS Amplify Gen 2 backend)  
**Performance Goals**: Flexible load times based on network conditions, Core Web Vitals compliance  
**Constraints**: 10MB max photo file size, 200MB storage per user, last-write-wins for concurrent edits, offline map capability  
**Scale/Scope**: Unlimited bands and POIs, authenticated users with AWS Cognito, community-driven content

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Core Principles Compliance
- [x] **React 19 First**: Uses React 19 features, no legacy patterns, leverages React Compiler optimizations
- [x] **AWS Amplify Gen 2**: Infrastructure code-defined in amplify/, uses Cognito auth, AppSync + DynamoDB
- [x] **Vite Build System**: Uses Vite for all builds, HMR functional, ES2020+ output, no legacy tools
- [x] **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode, Amplify generated types, no unjustified `any` types
- [x] **Component-First**: Reusable components, single responsibility, Amplify UI preferred, minimal global state
- [x] **Test-Driven Development**: All tests written first and failing before implementation, Red-Green-Refactor cycle enforced

### Technology Stack Compliance
- [x] **Required Tech**: React 19, TypeScript 5.6+, Vite 5.4+, Amplify Gen 2, Vitest, ESLint
- [x] **Forbidden Tech**: No class components, CRA, direct AWS SDK, client-only auth, manual provisioning

### Quality Gates Ready
- [x] TypeScript compilation setup
- [x] ESLint with React 19 rules configured
- [x] Testing strategy defined (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- [x] Amplify deployment pipeline ready

**Structure Decision**: React + AWS Amplify Gen 2 web application structure selected. This follows constitutional requirements with React 19 frontend components, Amplify Gen 2 backend resources in the amplify/ directory, and comprehensive test coverage using Vitest and React Testing Library. The structure supports TDD with clear separation between components, services, and tests.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented (no violations found)
